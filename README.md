This project is an iOS application developed using the **MVVM design pattern**. The app displays different movie categories and lists the movies added to each category. It utilizes the **Realm** database to store data and presents a customized pie chart to show the distribution of watched movies by genre.

## Usage

The app will initially save default movie categories to the Realm database. To view existing categories and the list of added movies, tap on the categories under the "Choose movie category" heading on the main screen. Tapping on a category will display the list of movies belonging to that category.

To view the pie chart, tap on the "Graph" button in the top middle corner of the main screen. This will open a pie chart showing the distribution of watched movies by genre.

To add movies, tap on the plus icon at the top right corner of the category list and enter the movie name in the "Item Name" field. Then, select the category you want to add the movie to and tap the "Add" button.

You can also delete a movie from the list by swiping right and tapping the "Delete" option.
